### So What's Going On?
F*** Off Grandpa is a roasting tournament between two elderly men. They go through 3 round matches delivering insults.
Insults are scored by the disrespect rating system. This system takes in keywords and scores them with there own set score.

Give it a try.

This is a solo project I built in react. It is designed with CSS and
Flexbox. The logic for the game was written in JavaScript and the
insults come from FOAAS API.
